Web Assembly Modules can also be stored in an OCI registry, using this [specification](https://github.com/solo-io/wasm/tree/master/spec).

Cosign can upload these using the `cosign wasm upload` command:

```shell
$ cosign upload wasm -f hello.wasm us.gcr.io/dlorenc-vmtest2/wasm
$ cosign sign --key cosign.key us.gcr.io/dlorenc-vmtest2/wasm
Enter password for private key:
